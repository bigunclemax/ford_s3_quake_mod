## How to use
**‚ÑπÔ∏è The package contains only the Quake 2 DEMO `pak0.pak` file.**  

In order to use the Full version, you need to get the `pak0.pak` file
from a **legit purchased** copy of the game and put them
inside the `SyncMyMod\files\other\quake2\baseq2` folder.

The game input relies on self written lib on top of QNX usb-hid subsystem.  
It **supports USB mouse and keyboard** and also it supports several
game controllers.
